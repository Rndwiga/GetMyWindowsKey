## What Is GetMyWindowsKey

It's all in the name "Get My Windows Key" !!  This program is designed to grab your windows COA key required to re-install on hardware where the key is not embedded. This will run on **any** windows operating system as long as it supports .NET Framework 4.0. It has been tested as far back as Windows XP.

## How do I use it ?

You can use the `GetMyWindowsKey.exe` file located in the `bin` folder directly or you can compile it from the source code. Since this does not have any dependencies other than .NET Framework 4.0, there is no need to run an installer. You can just run it as you would any other portable application (not like the one that claim to be portable then extract a bunch of stuff - this runs clean !!).
